# Signing

Tinycast is signed with a **stable self-signed identity** called `Tinycast Self-Signed`. It's not an
Apple Developer ID (there's no paid Apple account), but keeping the *same* identity on every build is
what makes macOS remember the Accessibility permission across rebuilds and updates — ad-hoc signing
changes every build and macOS forgets the grant.

You create this identity **once**. It is used for:

- **local dev builds** — so Accessibility persists while you develop (the Xcode project signs with it).

## 1. Create the `Tinycast Self-Signed` identity (once)

Run these in a terminal. They generate a self-signed code-signing certificate and import it into your
login keychain:

```sh
# Generate a self-signed code-signing cert (10-year, codeSigning use).
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -days 3650 \
  -keyout /tmp/tc-key.pem -out /tmp/tc-cert.pem \
  -subj "/CN=Tinycast Self-Signed" \
  -addext "basicConstraints=critical,CA:false" \
  -addext "keyUsage=critical,digitalSignature" \
  -addext "extendedKeyUsage=critical,codeSigning"

# Bundle it as a .p12 (the non-empty password keeps `security import` happy).
openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey /tmp/tc-key.pem -in /tmp/tc-cert.pem \
  -name "Tinycast Self-Signed" -out /tmp/tc.p12 -passout pass:tinycast

# Import into the login keychain so codesign can use it without prompting.
security import /tmp/tc.p12 -k ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db \
  -P tinycast -A -T /usr/bin/codesign

rm -f /tmp/tc-key.pem /tmp/tc-cert.pem /tmp/tc.p12
```

Verify it's there:

```sh
security find-identity -p codesigning | grep "Tinycast Self-Signed"
```

Now local builds (Xcode, VS Code F5, `xcodebuild`) sign with it, and you grant Accessibility once.

## Quarantine (separate from signing)

macOS quarantines anything downloaded from the internet, and Gatekeeper blocks even a correctly
self-signed app with an "unverified developer" warning. The Homebrew cask runs
`xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine` in `postflight`, so **brew users never touch it**. People who
download the DMG directly clear it once by hand.
